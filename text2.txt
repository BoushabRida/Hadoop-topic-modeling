Economics is a social science devoted to the understanding of all aspects of society affected by markets.

Business administration, business management, and managerial science, etc. focus on the firm and those aspects of markets that affect firm behavior. Business economics is devoted only to the latter. Business economics is a specialized branch of economics taught along side things like finance, accounting, marketing, production management, etc. Each of these subject areas can be an entire department in a faculty or school of business administration completely different from faculties or schools of social science.

Much of political science, also a social science, draws heavily from economics -- especially in areas like political economy, rational choice theory, and game theory. Once again, however, these are only subdisciplines of the larger field political science.

In conclusion, economics-related subjects probably covers far more ground than you previously imagined. Indeed, if you are equating economics and business with money-making, then the suggestion I have provided should suffice quite nicely, as most everyone will think of it in this narrow context.
