A vehicle is a machine such as a car, bus, or truck which has an engine and is used to carry people from place to place.
In order to operate a motor vehicle legally, a driver must obtain a minimum level of auto insurance to satisfy the laws of the road.
In the United States, if you are caught driving without insurance your license could be suspended and your vehicle impounded.
